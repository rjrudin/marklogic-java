This project used to hold the ml-javaclient-util, ml-junit, and ml-gradle projects, but those are all in separate repositories now. The sample-project that it used to hold to demonstrate ml-gradle usage is now in the ml-gradle repository. You can find the older sample-project on the dev branch of this repository. 

The only use of this repository now is as a Maven repository - the gh-pages branch is used for storing distributions of the aforementioned projects and others as well.
